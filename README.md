# Pearson Feedback:

"We picked this one as it is very immersive and realistic. The authentic, real-life tasks allow to learn in the context of use, which can be very effective. This game is not very scalable it terms of replayability with new contexts, but following the concept of arcade-like games for different purposes, we believe this can be a great addition to the other learning experiences. If we add some type of storyline and quests, asking learners to accomplish missions to accomplish some larger purpose, this can become a very compelling game."

## Resources/Inspiration

## Idea

You are a **cashier** in a foreign country of your choice. 

**Step 1:** As you pass the goods of the customers through the checkout, on the computer screen you see the name of that product- in both languages.  Also, you have buttons on the screen, that you press and the audio of the right pronunciation is played. 

**Step 2:** Your checkout computer is malfunctioning sometimes. In such cases, you have to type in the **name of the goods/quantity/price** manually. This way you practice the words you learned before.

## Features

**Core features:** 

These are the features that your prototype really needs to function or to prove your point.

- Hand tracking while passing goods from the checkout
- The computer screen of the checkout displays the names of goods (UI for hand tracking, buttons to press)

**Stretch goals:** 

These are features that are nice to have, and that you might implement if you have extra time, or in the future.

- Polishing
- Small talk witch customers

* This repository will be updated on a regular pace, for one week (9th November 2022).
* At the end of the week, a beautiful, running and error free VR protoype will be delivered.
